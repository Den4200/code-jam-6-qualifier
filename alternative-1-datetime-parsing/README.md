# Code Jam 6: Qualifier

- **Deadline:** 2020-01-10 12:00 UTC
- **Submission form:** https://forms.gle/MzzZs9mFMKe2bwP77
- **Theme suggestions:** https://forms.gle/ejkha9bF6kKjnRJJA

This qualifier task for the upcoming Winter Code Jam is inspired by the [ISO-8601 timestamp](https://www.iso.org/iso-8601-date-and-time-format.html). It will be your task to write a function that's able to parse some of the formats described by this standard. **Exactly which formats your function has to support is described below** in the requirements sections.

We have provided you with a stub function in [qualifier.py](./qualifier.py) and it is your job to write the function body. To qualify for the code jam, your function needs to pass all of the basic requirements listed below. Additional points will be awarded if your function also passes any of the advanced requirements.

**You must write all the parsing from scratch. Using any kind of datestring parsing feature in your solution, either from a third party or a standard library module, will disqualify you from joining the Code Jam.**

While you are allowed to rewrite the docstring of the function, please make sure to keep the [function signature](https://www.pythonlikeyoumeanit.com/Module2_EssentialsOfPython/Functions.html#The-def-Statement) as it is.

### Basic Requirements
  - Must return an instance of `datetime.datetime` that is equivalent to the given ISO-8601 timestamp
  - Must be able to parse date strings in the format `YYYY-MM-DD`
  - Must also be able to parse combined datetime strings in the format `<date>T<time>`, where `<time>` can be one of:
     - `hh:mm:ss`  (e.g. `2017-05-05T12:00:00`)
     - `hh:mm`     (e.g. `2017-05-05T12:00`)
     - `hh`        (e.g. `2017-05-05T12`)
  - If given invalid input, raise a `ValueError` explaining what went wrong.

### Advanced Requirements (optional, for extra points)
  - Support the truncated date format `YYYYMMDD`
  - Support fractional seconds with up to six decimals (e.g., `hh:mm:ss.sss`)
  - Support the truncated time formats `hhmmss.ssss`, `hhmmss`, `hhmm`
  - [Support time zones](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601#Time_zone_designators)
    - Timestamps without a timezone should return a naive `datetime.datetime` object
    - Timestamps with a timezone are relative to the UTC and should return an aware `datetime.datetime` object
      - Supported formats are `Z`, `±hh:mm`, `±hhmm` and `±hh`

**Note:** According to the ISO 8601 standard, if a string has both a date and a time part (`<date>T<time>`), then both parts must use the same format (i.e., both parts must be truncated or non-truncated). We will only test your function with strings for which this restriction holds, but we will **not** deduct points if your function also allows for mixed representations.

## Test Suite
To help you get started, we've written a test suite and test runner that will test your function for compliance with the **Basic Requirements** listed above. If you want to test your function against the advanced requirements, you will have to write your own test cases and add them to the stub class `Part002_AdvancedRequirements` in `test_qualifier.py`.

Even if you're not planning to run the test suite, you may want to have a look at the `test_qualifier.py` file, since the test cases also serve as examples of the strings we are going to use to test your function.

### Running of the Test Suite
You should be able to run the test suite with most modern versions of Python. (We have tested it with Python 3.6+, but it may also work with Python 3.5.)

To run the test suite, you should first copy the **entire** `alternative-1-datetime-parsing` directory, including the `testsuite` subdirectory, to your local PC. After you've done that, follow these steps:

1. Add your code, including your `parse_iso8601` main function, to `qualifier.py`
2. Open a terminal/command window and navigate to the root folder (the folder containing `qualifier.py`)
3. Run the test suite with `python -m testsuite`
    - You may have to replace `python` with the command you use to run Python from the command line.

Once you pass all the basic requirements, the test suite will also run a benchmark on your function to see how fast it is.

## Code Style & Readability
While not a hard requirement, we will take code style and readability into account when judging submissions for both the qualifier as well as the code jam itself. Please try to keep your code readable for yourself and others, and try to comply with [PEP 8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/). To check if your code follows PEP 8, we will use a tool called [flake8](http://flake8.pycqa.org/en/latest/) configured with a maximum line length of 100. If you want to run flake8 yourself, you can use `flake8 --max-line-length=100 /path/to/code` to run it with the same settings as we will use. (Note: you will need to [install flake8](http://flake8.pycqa.org/en/latest/index.html#installation) first.)

## Examples
Here are a few examples of a `parse_iso8601` function in action. Obviously, these examples do not cover all of the requirements, so make sure to test your function comprehensively with test cases of your own before submitting it.

```py
>>> parse_iso8601("2019-12-16")
datetime.datetime(2019, 12, 16, 0, 0)
>>> parse_iso8601("2017-01-08T12")
datetime.datetime(2017, 1, 8, 12, 0)
>>> parse_iso8601("2000-10-16T09:23:61")
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 7, in parse_iso8601
ValueError: Invalid value for seconds
```

## Notes
- Due to the limitations of Python's `datetime` module, some dates specified in the ISO-8601 standard are impossible to be represented as a `datetime.datetime`. Therefore, those formats have not been included in the challenge.

- We are aware that `datetime.datetime` has a built-in classmethod, `datetime.fromisoformat`, to parse ISO-8601 timestamps. Since it is your task to write a parser, using the built-in parser will lead to you not passing the qualifier.

- **Please note that the qualifier task is supposed to be an individual challenge.** This means that you should not discuss (parts of) your solution to the qualifier task in public (including our server) and that you should try to solve it individually. Obviously, this does not mean that you can't do research or ask questions about the Python concepts you're using to solve the qualifier, but try to use general examples when you post code during this process.
